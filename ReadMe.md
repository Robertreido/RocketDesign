The files in this directory are all related to the Gimbal design which is 3D printed. They are all solidworks files so will need to be used on a machine that has that. The Gimbal Adapter parts are required when using the GS-9025MG Servo motors, this is due to the servos size being a lot smaller. To connect all these parts the following hardware will be required, e.g bolts:
-4 x M3 Hex Nut
-2 x M3 10mm
-2 x M3 12mm
-4 x M3 20mm
