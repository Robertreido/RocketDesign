Setting up and Test Servo Motors - GS-9025MG

-Red is V++ (6V), Brown is Ground, Orange is PWM input
-Functioning at 50HZ PWM
-Duty Cycle vary from 0.45ms - 2.5ms, 2.25% - 12.5
-Tested response when PWM is changed without source power then source power 
switched on. Servo responded instanteously, which is ideal if the power is to
ever change.
-Middle point for the Yaw Servo was set 1.4ms
-Same for the Pitch Servo, @ 1.4ms
-Pitch Axis Gimbal Operating Cycle: 1.19ms-159ms.
-Yaw Axis Gimbal Operating Cycle: 1.05ms-159ms.
-These are duty cycles that have the gimbal operating at maximum angles, these
should not be exceeded as it will potentially damage the gimbal.

From this anaylsis we can determine how we are going to control the servos from
the MCU. By producing a modulated 50Hz square wave, aka PWM, on one of the pins
we will be able to replocate these lab results. From the software integration we
should ideally be able to set the duty cycle of the PWM and therefore set the
angle of the servos individually.
